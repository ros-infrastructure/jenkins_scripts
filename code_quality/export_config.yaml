        name: STCYC
        metric_type: function
        brief: Cyclomatic complexity
        description: 'Cyclomatic complexity is calculated as the number of decisions plus 1. High cyclomatic complexity indicates inadequate modularization or too much logic in one function. Software metric research has indicated that functions with a cyclomatic complexity greater than 10 tend to have problems related to their complexity.'

    STSUB:    
        name: STSUB
        metric_type: function
        brief: Number of Function Calls
        description: 'The number of function calls within a function. Functions with a large number of function calls are more difficult to understand because their functionality is spread across several components.

        name: STCDN
        metric_type: file   
        brief: Comment to code ratio
        description: 'This metric is defined to be the number of visible characters in comments divided by the number of visible characters outside comments. Comment delimiters are ignored. Whitespace characters in strings are treated as visible characters. A large metric value may indicate that there are too many comments - an attribute that can make a module difficult to read. A small value may indicate that there are not enough.'

        metric_type: class
        brief: Coupling between objects
        description: 'This is a count of the number of methods (member functions) or member objects of other classes accessed by a class. Only classes outside the inheritance hierarchy are considered, because you would expect interaction with base and derived classes. Coupling to classes outside the inheritance tree should be viewed with suspicion as it makes the class less 4 independent and less re-usable.'

        description: 'This represents the number of derivations from the furthest base class down to this class.

        metric_type: class
        brief: Number of immediate children
        description: 'This is the number of classes for which this class is an immediate base class. A high figure for

knock-on effects from changes to it.'
